## Welcome to YueyangYan's GitHub Pages

I'm Yueyang Yan. It is my third year to study in Lehigh University. My majors are Journalism and Japanese. 

I'm a TA for elementary Japanese courses, and I'm also in Lehigh's news agency——Brown and White. My main job in Brown and White is interviewing, analyzing the data, writing the report and taking photos.
