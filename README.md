### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yueyang Yan. It is my third year to study in Lehigh University. My majors are Journalism and Japanese. 

I'm a TA for elementary Japanese courses, and I'm also in Lehigh's news agencyâ€”â€”Brown and White. My main job in Brown and White is interviewing, analyzing the data, writing the report and taking photos.
